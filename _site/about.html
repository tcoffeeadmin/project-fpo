                        Funeral Plan Options is a partner of Safe Hands Funeral Plans, one of the UK's premier funeral planning companies. They work with a national network of over 1600+ will writers, solicitors, financial advisors, and other intermediaries, who offer our products as part of their estate planning services.<br>

                        With a large portion of our business being conducted via this network of professional consultants, our plans are sold in a much more sensitive and personal manner than they would be were we to rely on the more aggressive and impersonal call-centre approach that some other providers favour. <br>

                        It is our ongoing aim to provide all of our customers with a better experience of arranging their funeral plan.
